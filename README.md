## Moody Music

Moody App was the result of a 24hr pair-programming "hackathon". Fellow developers Ali Akbar and Matt Lemche created a light-weight, song-suggesting app that reads text input to asses tone. Using a combination of an API that reads sentiment from text, and the music catalog API from LastFM, we were able to create an app that suggests songs based on the user's perceived mood.
